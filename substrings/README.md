# Substrings

This challenge is to implement a method `#substrings` that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. This method should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

Makes sure the string can handle multiple words.
